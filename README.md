# HandGestureControl
This project utilizes MediaPipe, a powerful framework by Google for real-time hand tracking, and OpenCV for capturing video frames from the webcam. The system processes the frames to detect hand landmarks, calculates angles between different points on the hand, and sends these angles to a microcontroller through a serial connection.
